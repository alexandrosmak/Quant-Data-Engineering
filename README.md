# Market Data Quality Pipeline

The project is intentionally compact: it demonstrates clean ETL structure, data quality checks, test coverage, and researcher-ready outputs.

## Why this project

A quant data engineering platform needs to make new datasets available safely. That means:

- ingest raw data without destroying the original source
- normalize timestamps, symbols, event types, and numeric fields
- run explicit quality checks before data reaches researchers
- write clean outputs in analysis-friendly formats
- produce a simple report that explains what passed and what failed to ensure proper results communication

## What it does

The pipeline reads a small five-day synthetic TAQ-like CSV containing trades and quotes, validates it, cleans it, and writes:

- `data/processed/market_events.csv`
- `data/processed/market_events.parquet` if `pyarrow` is installed
- `reports/data_quality_report.md`
- `reports/data_quality_summary.json`

Checks implemented:

- required schema validation
- missing-value checks
- duplicate event detection
- non-positive price/size checks
- crossed quote detection where `bid_price > ask_price`
- abnormal trade return check per symbol
- timestamp ordering check per symbol

## Notebook demo

Open:

``` notebooks/market_data_quality_demo.ipynb
```

The notebook shows the pipeline step by step: loading raw events, normalizing fields, running checks, inspecting failed checks as a DataFrame, writing outputs, and reading the generated quality report.

## Example output

The included sample data currently produces:

```text
Data Quality Report
Rows processed: 343
Checks failed: 4

Failed checks:
- duplicate_events: 2 rows
- non_positive_prices: 1 row
- crossed_quotes: 1 row
- abnormal_trade_returns: 4 rows
```

## Engineering choices

- The raw input is treated as immutable.
- Validation and transformation are separate functions.
- Each quality check returns structured records, making checks easy to test and extend.
- The output is written as CSV for easy inspection and Parquet when available for columnar analytics.
- The pipeline exits successfully but flags quality failures in the report, which is useful for research workflows where bad rows may need investigation rather than immediate deletion.
